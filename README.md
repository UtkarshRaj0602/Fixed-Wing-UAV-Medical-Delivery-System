# Fixed-Wing-UAV-For-Medical-Delivery-System (In-Progress)
Currently making a Fixed Wing UAV for medical delivery and supplies as my major capstone project with my team.


Our fixed wing UAV, is an aircraft that operates without a human pilot onboard(fully autonomous), it is controlled either remotely by a human operator or autonomously via onboard computers. Our fixed wing will be autonomously controlled and will be used to delivery medicines and other emergency medical deliveries. The average cruise speed of our UAV is nearly about 40 - 80km/hr and the cruise speed range can go upto 100km's and more. By using our fixed wing UAV, the uncertainities of the medical delivery system can be reduced drastically and even at the time of emergency and natural calamities the medical deliviers can be done effectively and efficiently.    


Unique Selling Points: 

1. Can attain a cruise speed of 40-80km/hr with a lift capapcity of 2.5kg's and more at 36km'/hr of cruise speed.
2. Very fast and less complicated mechanism of loading and unloading of the payload.
3. Can attain a flight height of upto 1km's in the atmosphere. 
4. Real time tracking flight tracking is also available. 
5. The body of the UAV is highly rigid. 
6. THe UAV is very light in weight (would nearly weigh around 1 to 1.5 kg's in weight).


Tools used in this project: 

1. XFLR5 - For UAV designing.
2. Solidworks for full designing and rendering process.
3. Ansys for simulations and CFDS.
4. Raspberry PI for overall processing, functioning, signal transmission and serial protocols of the UAV.
5. Pixhawk PX4 autopilot flight controller for controlling the UAV.
6. GPS for real time navigation and tracking of the UAV.


Learning Outcomes:

1. Dived deep into flight and UAV desinging. Also, learned desinging using XFLR5.
2. Learned about pixhawk flight controller, it's uses and its various functioning.
3. Dived further into microcontrollers and raspberry pi, their fucntioning and their programming.
4. Hands-on experience with solidworks and its various properties like surfacing, airfoil designing, etc.
5. Hands-on experience with ansys and its properties like fluent flow, etc.
6. Learned about how manufacturing process is carried out in the real world. 
7. Learned about team management, working in team, guiding the fellow team mates and project management.
8. Dived deep into 3d printing and ligth weight PLA.
